Brains of the computer
Arithmetic calculations are performed using the Arithmetic/Logical Unit  or ALU
Control unit decodes and executes instructions
Arithmetic operations are performed using binary number system

3Control Unit
The fetch/execute cycle is 
the steps the CPU takes to execute an instruction
Performing the action specified by an instruction is known as 
executing the 
instruction
The program counter (PC) holds the memory address of the next instructionFetch the instruction to
which the PC points
Increment the PC
Execute the fetched
instruction

9Software Engineering Goals
Reliability
Understandability
Cost Effectiveness
Adaptability
Reusability
Reliability
An unreliable life-critical system can be fatal
Understandability
Future development is difficult if software is hard to understand
Cost Effectiveness
Cost to develop and maintain should not exceed profit
Adaptability
System that is adaptive is easier to alter and expand
Reusability
Improves reliability, maintainability, and profitability

Extract the relevant object properties while ignoring inessentials
Defines a view of the object
Example - car
Car dealer views a car from selling features standpoint 
Price, length of warranty, color, …
Mechanic views a car from systems maintenance standpoint
Size of the oil filter, type of spark plugs, …Abstraction
Price? Oil change?
Encapsulation
Steps
Decompose an object into parts
Hide and protect essential information
Supply interface that allows information to be modified in a 
controlled and useful manner 
Internal representation can be changed without affecting other system parts
Example - car radio
Interface consists of controlsand power and antenna connectors
The details of how it works is hidden
To install and use a radio
Do not need to know anything about the radio’s electronics

11Modularity
Dividing an object into smaller pieces or modules so that the 
object is easier to understand and manipulate
Most complex systems are modular
Example - Automobile can be decomposed into subsystems
Cooling system
Radiator Thermostat Water pump
Ignition system
Battery Starter Spark plugs
Hierarchy
Hierarchy 
Ranking or ordering of objects based on some relationship between them
Help us understand complex systems
Example - a company hierarchy helps employees understand the company and their positions within it
For complex systems, a useful way of ordering similar abstractions is a taxonomy from least general to most general

OO Design and Programming
Object-oriented design and programming methodology supports 
good software engineering
Promotes thinking in a way that models the way we think and interact with the real world
Example - watching television
The remote is a physical object withproperties
Weight, size, can send messageto the television
The television is also a physical objectwith various properties

13Objects
An object is almost anything with the following characteristics
Name
Properties
The ability to act upon receiving a message
Basic message types
Directive to perform an action
Request to change one of its properties
The individual digits of a binary number are referred to as bits
Each bit represents a power of two

Two’s Complement
Representation for signed binary numbers
Leading bit is a sign bit
Binary number with leading 0 is positive
Binary number with leading 1 is negative
Magnitude of positive numbers is just the binary representation
Magnitude of negative numbers is found by
Complement the bits
Replace all the 1's with 0's, and all the 0's with 1's
Add one to the complemented number
The carry in the most significant bit position is thrown away when performing arithmetic
