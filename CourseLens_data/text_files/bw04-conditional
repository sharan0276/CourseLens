Boolean Algebra
Logical expressions have the one of two values - true or false
A rectangle has three sides
The instructor has a pleasant smile
The branch of mathematics is called Boolean algebra
Developed by the British mathematician George Boole in the 
19th century
Three key logical operators

Or
Not

Boolean Algebra
Truth tables
Lists all combinations of operand values and the result of the 
operation for each combination

Boolean Algebra
Can create complex logical expressions by combining simple logical expressions
Example
not (P and Q)
A truth table can be used to determine when a logical expression is true
P Q P and Q not (P and Q)
False False False TrueFalse True False TrueTrue False False TrueTrue True True False

A Boolean Type
C++ contains a type named bool
Type bool has two symbolic constants
true
false
Boolean operators
The andoperator is &&
The oroperator is ||
The notoperator is !
Warning
&and |are also operators so be careful what you type
A Boolean Type
Example logical expressions
bool P = true;
bool Q = false;
bool R = true;bool S = (P && Q);bool T = ((!Q) || R);bool U = !(R && (!Q));

Relational Operators
Equality operators
==
!=
Examples
int i = 32;
int k = 45;
bool q = (i == k);
bool r = (i != k);
Relational Operators
Ordering operators
<
>
>=
<=
Examples
int i = 5;
int k = 12;
bool p = (i < 10);
bool q = (k > i);
bool r = (i >= k);
bool s = (k <= 12);

Conditional Constructs
Provide
Ability to control whether a statement list is executed
Two constructs
If statement
if
if-else
if-else-ef
Switch statement
Left for reading
The Basic If Statement
Syntax
if(Expression )
Action
If the Expression is true then 
execute Action
Action is either a single 
statement or a group of statements within bracesExpression
Actiontrue false

Example
if (Value < 0) {
Value = -Value;
}
Value < 0
Value = -Value/G57/G55/G58/G48 /G49/G44/G4f/G56/G48Is our number negative?
If  Value is not less
than zero then our
number is fine as isIf Value is less than
zero then we need to
update its value to
that of its additive
inverse
Our number is
now definitely
nonnegative
Sorting Two Numbers
cout << "Enter two integers: ";
int Value1;int Value2;
cin >> Value1 >> Value2;
if (Value1 > Value2) {
int RememberValue1 = Value1;Value1 = Value2;Value2 = RememberValue1;
}
cout << "The input in sorted order: "
<< Value1 << " " << Value2 << endl;

Semantics
value2 < value1
 int rememberValue1 = value1
 value1 = value2
 value2 = rememberValue1/G57/G55/G58/G48 /G49/G44/G4f/G56/G48Are  the numbers
out of order
Rearrange value1
and value2 to
put their values
in the proper
order
The numbers were
initially in orderThe  numbers were
rearranged into the
proper order
The numbers are in
order
What is the Output?
int m = 5;
int n = 10;
if (m < n) 
++m;++n;
cout << 
"m = "<< m << "n = "n << endl;

Syntax

Finding the Max
cout << "Enter two integers: ";
int Value1;int Value2;
cin >> Value1 >> Value2;
int Max;if (Value1 < Value2) {
Max = Value2;
}
else {
Max = Value1;
}cout << "Maximum of inputs is: " << Max << endl;

--- Page Break ---

12
Finding the Max
Value1 < Value2
Max = Value2 Max = Value1/G57/G55/G58/G48 /G49/G44/G4f/G56/G48Is Value2 larger than Value1
Yes, it is . So Value2 is
larger than Value1. In
this case, Max is set
to Value2No, its not. So Value1
is at least as large as
Value2. In this case,
Max is set to Value1
Either case, Max is set
correctly
Selection
It is often the case that depending upon the value of an 
expression we want to perform a particular action
Two major ways of accomplishing this choice
if-else-if statement
if-else statements “glued” together
Switch statement

else {
cout << nbr << " is zero" << endl;
