Program statement
Definition
Declaration
Action
Executable unit
Named set of program statements
Different languages refer to executable units by different 
names
Subroutine:  Fortran and Basic
Procedure: Pascal
Function : C++Program Organization

Program Organization
C++ program
Collection of  definitions, declarations and functions
Collection can span multiple files
Advantages
Structured into small understandable units
Complexity is reduced
Overall program size decreases
Object
Object is a representation of some information
Name
Values or properties
Data members
Ability to react to requests (messages)!!
Member functions
When an object receives a message, one of two actions are 
performed
Object is directed to perform an action
Object changes one of its properties

// Extract length and widthcout << "Rectangle dimensions: ";float Length;float Width;
cin >> Length >> Width;
// Compute and insert the areafloat Area = Length * Width;

Area.cpp Output
Comments
Allow prose or commentary to be included in program
Importance
Programs are read far more often than they are written
Programs need to be understood so that they can be 
maintained
C++ has two conventions for comments
//single line comment (preferred)
/*long comment */(save for debugging)
Typical uses
Identify program and who wrote it
Record when program was written
Add descriptions of modifications

Fundamental C++ Objects
C++ has a large number of fundamental or built-in object types
The fundamental object types fall into one of three categories
Integer objects
Floating-point objects
Character objects

P3.14
Integer Object Types
The basic integer object type is int
The size of an intdepends on the machine and the 
compiler
On PCs it is normally 16 or 32 bits
Other integers object types
short : typically uses less bits
long : typically uses more bits
Different types allow programmers to use resources more 
efficiently
Standard arithmetic and relational operations are available for these types

7
Integer Constants
Integer constants are positive or negative whole numbers
Integer constant forms
Decimal
Octal (base 8)
Digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Hexadecimal (base 16)
Digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a , b, c, d, e, f, A, B, C,
D, E, F
Consider
31 oct  and 25  dec
Decimal Constants
Examples
97
40000L 
50000
23a (illegal)
The type of the constant depends on its size, unless the type specifier is usedL or l indicates long integer

8
Character Object Types
Character type char is related to the integer types
Characters are encoded using a scheme where an integer 
represents a particular character
ASCII is the dominant encoding scheme
Examples
' 'encoded as 32 '+'encoded as 43
'A'encoded as 65 'Z'encoded as 90
'a'encoded as 97 'z'encoded as 122 
Appendix A gives the complete ASCII character set
Character Operations
Arithmetic and relational operations are defined for characters 
types
'a' < 'b' is true
'4' > '3' is true
'6' <= '2' is false

--- Page Break ---

9
Character Constants
Explicit (literal) characters within single quotes
'a','D','*'
Special characters - delineated by a backslash \
Two character sequences (escape codes)
Some important special escape codes
\tdenotes a tab \ndenotes a new line
\\denotes a backslash \'denotes a single 
quote
\"denotes a double quote
'\t' is the explicit tab character, '\n' is the explicit new line 
character, and so on
Literal String Constants
A literal string constant is a sequence of zero or more 
characters enclosed in double quotes
"We are even loonier than you think"
"Rust never sleeps\n"
"Nilla is a Labrador Retriever"
Not a fundamental type

Floating-Point Object Types 
Floating-point object types represent real numbers
Integer part
Fractional part
The number 108.1517 breaks down into the following parts
108 - integer part
1517 - fractional part
C++ provides three floating-point object types
float
double
long double
Floating-Point Constants
Standard decimal notation
134.1230.15F
Standard scientific notation
1.45E6 0.979e-3L
When not specified, floating-point constants are of type doubleF or f indicates single precision 
floating point value
L or l indicates long double 
floating point value

11
Names
Used to denote program values or components
A valid name is a sequence of
Letters (upper and lowercase)
Digits
A name cannot start with a digit
Underscores
A name should not normally start with an underscore
Names are case sensitive
MyObject is a different name than MYOBJECT
There are two kinds of names
Keywords
Identifiers
Keywords
Keywords are words reserved as part of the language
int, return , float , double
They cannot be used by the programmer to name things
They consist of lowercase letters only
They have special meaning to the compiler

--- Page Break ---

12
Identifiers
Identifiers should be 
Short enough to be reasonable to type (single word is norm)
Standard abbreviations are fine (but only standard 
abbreviations)
Long enough to be understandable
When using multiple word identifiers capitalize the first 
letter of each word
Examples
Min
Temperature
CameraAngle
CurrentNbrPoints
Definitions
All objects that are used in a program must be defined
An object definition specifies
Type
Name
General definition form 
Our convention is one definition per statement!Type Id, Id, ..., Id;Known
typeList of one or
more identifiers

--- Page Break ---

13
Examples
char Response;
int MinElement;float Score;
float Temperature;
int i;int n;char c;float x;Objects are uninitialized with 
this definition form
(Value of a object is 
whatever is in itsassigned memory location) 
Arithmetic Operators
Common
Addition +
Subtraction -
Multiplication *
Division /
Mod %
Note
No exponentiation operator
Single division operator
Operators are overloaded to work with more than one type of objectWrite  m*x + b
not     mx + b

--- Page Break ---

14
Integer Division
Integer division produces an integer result
Truncates the result
Examples
3 / 2 evaluates to 1
4 / 6 evaluates to 0
10 / 3 evaluates to 3
Mod
Produces the remainder of the division
Examples
5 % 2 evaluates to 1
12 % 4 evaluates to 0
4 % 5 evaluates to 4

--- Page Break ---

15
Operators and Precedence
Consider  mx + b
Consider m*x + b which of the following is it equivalent to
(m * x) + b
m * (x + b)
Operator precedence tells how to evaluate expressions
Standard precedence order
() Evaluate first, if nested innermost
done first
* / % Evaluate second. If there are several,
then evaluate from left-to-right
+ - Evaluate third. If there are several,
then evaluate from left-to-right
Operator Precedence
Examples
20 - 4 / 5  * 2   +   3 * 5  % 4
(4 / 5)
((4 / 5) * 2)((4 / 5) * 2)     (3 * 5)
((4 / 5) * 2)    ((3 * 5) % 4)
(20 -((4 / 5) * 2))   ((3 * 5) % 4)(20 -((4 / 5) * 2)) + ((3 * 5) % 4)

16
Defining and Initializing
When an object is defined using the basic form, the memory 
allotted to it contains random information
Better idea to specify its desired value at the same time
Exception is when the next statement is an extraction for the object
Remember our convention of one definition per statement!
Examples
int FahrenheitFreezing = 32;
char FinalGrade = 'A';cout << "Slope of line: ";float m;cin >> m;cout << "Intercept: ";float b;
cin >> b;
cout << "X value of interest: ";float x;cin >> x;float y = (m * x) + b;
