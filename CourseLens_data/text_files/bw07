1The Class Construct
Defining objects with attributes 
and behavior

Class Types
Class construct
Allows programmers to define new data types for 
representing information
Class type objects can have both attribute components and behavior components
Provides the object-oriented programming in C++

Terminology
Client
Program using a class
Object behaviors
Realized in C++ via member functions (methods)
Object attributes
Are known as data members in C++
Client
Program using a class
Object behaviors
Realized in C++ via member functions (methods)
RectangleShapes can be drawn or resized
Object attributes
Are known as data members in C++
Client
Program using a class
Object behaviors
Realized in C++ via member functions (methods)
RectangleShapes can be drawn or resized
Object attributes
Are known as data members in C++
RectangleShapes have width, height, position, color
Member Functions
Provide a controlled interface to data members and object 
access and manipulation
Create objects of the class
Inspect, mutate, and manipulate object of the class
Can be used to keep data members in a correct state
SetSize()
SetColor()
Draw()

Member Functions
Constructors
Member functions that initialize an object during its 
definition
RectangleShape R(W, x, y, c, w, h);
Factoid
Constructors do not have a type
Considered superfluous
Member Functions
Inspectors
Member functions that act as a messenger that returns the 
value of an attribute
Example
RectangleShapes have an inspector GetColor()
color CurrColor = R.GetColor();

4
Member Functions
Mutators
Changes the value of an attribute
Example
RectangleShapes have a mutator SetColor()
R.SetColor(Black);
Member Functions
Facilitators
Causes an object to perform some action or service
Example
RectangleShapes have a facilitator Draw()
R.Draw();

A Simple RectangleShape Class
Consider a simpler version of the RectangleShape than what is 
defined in rect.h
Giving the class definition notthe implementation
The definition in rect.h uses inheritance and member functions with default parameters
If you are wondering what is missing
Default constructor parameters
Member function
Erase()
Inherited member functions
HasBorder(), SetBorder(),  and ClearBorder()
#ifndef RECT_SHAPE_H
#define RECT_SHAPE_H#include "ezwin.h"class RectangleShape {
public:
// constructorRectangleShape(SimpleWindow &Window,
float XCoord, float YCoord, const color &c,
float Width, float Height);
// facilitatorvoid Draw();SimpleRectangleShapeHeaderFile
Passed by reference, do not want 
a copy of the window
ezwin.h get us definitions of SimpleWindow and colorAccess
right
indicates 
no 
limitations

can use

// inspectors
color GetColor() const;float GetWidth() const;
float GetHeight() const;
void GetSize(float &Width, float &Height)
const;
void GetPosition(float &XCoord, float &YCoord)
const;
SimpleWindow& GetWindow() const;Simple RectangleShape
Reference return, 
brings actual window (not a copy)Indicates the member functions won’t change the object
// mutators
void SetColor(const color &c);
void SetPosition(float XCoord, float YCoord);void SetSize(float Width, float Height);Simple RectangleShape
Lack of const indicate the member 
function might change the object

private:
// data membersSimpleWindow &Window;
float thisXCenter;
float thisYCenter;color thisColor;float thisWidth;float thisHeight;
};
#endifSimple RectangleShape
A client cannot 
directly access either private or protected data membersAccess right
Close of #ifndef directive
Access Tests
Consider
SimpleWindow W("Testing", 20, 10);
RectangleShape R(W, 2, 2, Blue, 4, 3);
const RectangleShape S(W, 15, 10, Red, 5, 6);
Can we do the following?
color c = R.GetColor();
color d = S.GetColor();
color d = R.thisColor;
R.DetColor(Yellow);
S.SetColor(Black);
